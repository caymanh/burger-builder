 ### Description

Burger Builder is a restaurant app that lets customize the burger that they want to eat. Whenever the user increases or decreases the quantity of an ingredient, the app will update in real-time to display their customized burger and price of the burger. Once the user has cutomized their burger, they will be able to place an order by clicking the 'Order Now' button to proceed to check out. 

 The app is built using Node, React, and Webpack.

 The live app can be accessed [here](https://pacific-stream-43723.herokuapp.com/).
